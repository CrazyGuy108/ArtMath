# ArtMath
Entry for [Expo Hacks](http://trivalleyyouthexpo.com/hackathon.html).

## Inspiration
We wanted to create art using computer algorithms to inspire today's artists.

## What it does
Selects from a list of algorithms and, using some user-provided parameters, creates some cool mathematical art.

## How we built it
We used HTML/CSS/JS to create a lightweight webapp.

## Challenges we ran into
We weren't too familiar with JavaScript and we didn't have experience with fractals.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Dropdown menu to select certain options.

## What we learned
* Fractals are a lot more complex than they look.
* How to use the HTML5 Canvas feature.

## What's next for ArtMath
More unique and cooler types of computer art.
